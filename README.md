# Hack Computer Software Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of the Hack computer software as part of the **Nand2Tetris** course by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. The project is an ongoing effort to build a fully functional computer system from the ground up, starting with basic logic gates and culminating in a high-level programming language.

## About the Project

The **Nand2Tetris** course is a hands-on journey through the elements of computing systems. In this repository, I focus on the software aspect of the Hack computer, which is a simple yet powerful 16-bit computer designed for educational purposes. The implementation includes:

- **Assembler**: Translates Hack assembly code into machine code.
- **Virtual Machine**: Executes intermediate VM code and translates it into Hack assembly.
- **Compiler**: Compiles a high-level language (Jack) into VM code.

## Implementation Details

The project is written in **C/C++**, and I am currently in the process of learning and improving my C and C++ programming skills. This implementation serves as both a learning exercise and a practical application of the concepts taught in the Nand2Tetris course.

### Features

- **Hack Assembler**: Converts Hack assembly language into binary machine code.
- **Virtual Machine**: Executes VM code and handles stack-based operations.
- **Jack Compiler**: Compiles Jack language programs into VM code.
